<!-- PROPOSAL -->
## Proposal

To create a program that would output a calendar and the holidays in the month to a user, given user inputs of the name of the month and the day the month starts.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The purpose of this program is to print a month's calendar depending on a user's inputs. A user inputs the first day of the month and then the month the calendar is for, with this information, the program knows where to start the calendar and how many days there are in that month. The program then uses recursion to assign increasing date values in a 2D array keeping in mind of the day the month starts as well as the total number of days in the month. At the end, the program also prints the holidays in that month.
